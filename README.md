## CHALLENGES AND DEFECTS FACED:

1.Faced issue in File handling:
    
       Before working with this project, I just only know how to read a text file and how to write a text file.

       While working on this project for me it seems hard to work in CSV files.
   
       CSV file writer and reader issue:

       Whenever, I can convert a ArrayList into a CSV file, it write the content with double quotes("").SO, to remove that quotes I used 
       [CSVWriter.NO_QUOTE_CHARACTER,CSVWriterDEFAULT_ESCAPE_CHARACTER,CSVWriter.RFC4180_LINE_END] inbuilt functions .

2.Setting and getting categories for products from CSV file:

        At first, I can't set category for the project object, also I can't retrieve the arraylist from the method.

        So, I coded the logic in single method from that I returned the arraylist for displaying to the user.

        And for each project in the arraylist, I set the category object, so that it can accessed easily.
3.While doing logic part for edit operation:

        Whenever I do edit part the entire file got erased and my edited object alone got printed.

        To rectify that part, I read the entire file using CSVReader and I stored it as List of strings, 
        using get() method I get the particular index to make the changes without affecting the rest of the objects.
